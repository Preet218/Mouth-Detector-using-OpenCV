# Mouth-Detector-using-OpenCV
In this notebook, we have used haar-smile cascade from OpenCV to detect mouth in the input coming from webcam. Then we display the image with 2 red dots near both the edge of the mouth. Then if the mouth is open wider than a predefined value a gray scale image is showed.
